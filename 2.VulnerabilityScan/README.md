# Vulnerability Scan & Network Discovery (Nmap)

# Objective
Perform host discovery and basic vulnerability scanning within a **safe, isolated virtual network** to identify active devices, open ports, and running services.

# Tools Used
- Kali Linux (VirtualBox)
- Nmap
- Host-only network (192.168.56.0/24)

# Steps Performed
1. Created a Host-Only network in VirtualBox and connected both attacker and target VMs.  
2. Verified connectivity using a **ping sweep** across the subnet `192.168.56.0/24`.  
3. Identified live hosts and their MAC addresses using `nmap -sn`.  
4. Conducted a **safe TCP connect scan** on the target using  
   `nmap -sT -p 1-1000 -sV --version-intensity 0 192.168.56.102`.  
5. Recorded open ports, service versions, and saved outputs (`.txt` + screenshots).  
6. Documented findings and security recommendations.

# Key Observations
- **Network Discovery:** Four active hosts were detected within the 192.168.56.0/24 range (host, attacker, target, and VirtualBox adapter).  
- **Open Port:** Only port `22/tcp` (SSH) was open on the target machine.  
- **Service:** SSH identified as **OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 8 (protocol 2.0)**.  
- **Security Posture:** All other ports were closed, indicating minimal exposure and good baseline hardening.

# What I Learned
- How to use **Nmap** for host discovery (`-sn` for port scan) and safe port scanning (`-sT` for tcp, `-sV` for service run on target).  
- How to interpret Nmap outputs and detect active services on a target.  
- The importance of isolating test environments to ensure ethical scanning.  
- How to write a professional vulnerability scan report and remediation summary.
